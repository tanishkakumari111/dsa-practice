üîë Idea
1. Precompute inc[i] = length of strictly increasing subarray starting at index i. ‚úÖ O(n)
2. The answer is the maximum k such that there exists i with:

-----> inc[i] >= k  AND  inc[i+k] >= k

3. Since larger k implies stricter condition, we can binary search k from 1 to n/2.
4. For a given k, scan i = 0 ‚Üí n - 2*k and check if condition holds. ‚úÖ O(n) per check

Total complexity = O(n log n)

/*
‚è≥ Complexity
Time: O(n log n) ‚Üí O(n) to build inc, O(n) to check each mid, log n binary search steps
Space: O(n) for inc array

This handles tricky plateaus and large arrays efficiently.
If you want, I can also show a truly O(n) solution without binary search, which finds max k in a single pass. It‚Äôs a bit trickier but fastest possible. (SLIDING WINDOW)

‚úÖ Key Insight:
By precomputing the increasing streak lengths and moving through each streak, we can determine the max possible k for adjacent increasing subarrays in one pass.
This handles tricky plateaus automatically and avoids binary search.
